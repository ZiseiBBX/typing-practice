# Typing Practice
--------------------
#### Ever wanted to test them speedy fingers of yours by gauging how well you do against other humans or even aliens? Well, now's your chance! Head on over to [Typing Practice](https://typing-practice-zisei.web.app) and determine how good you actually are!
###### Please do note this will probably not represent how fast you type because of the way words show up on screen. However, the disadvantage is applicable to everyone so it might be good enough to compare yourself to others than yourself to yourself, I guess....
